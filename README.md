## ▶️ How to run it locally

No build step and no dependencies — it's plain HTML/CSS/JS.

**Option 1 — open the file directly**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sandippgautam/Rajan_Bam_Frontend.git
   cd Rajan_Bam_Frontend
   ```
2. Double-click `index.html`, or open it in your browser.

**Option 2 — run a local server** (recommended, so paths behave exactly like production)

```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# or Node
npx serve .
```

Then visit **http://localhost:8000** in your browser.

> Tip: in VS Code you can also use the **Live Server** extension — right-click
> `index.html` → *Open with Live Server*.

## 🚀 Deployment (GitHub Pages)

The site is deployed with **GitHub Pages** directly from this repository:

1. Push to the `main` branch.
2. In the repo, go to **Settings → Pages**.
3. Under *Build and deployment*, set **Source: Deploy from a branch**,
   **Branch: `main` / `root`**, then **Save**.
4. GitHub publishes the site at
   `https://sandippgautam.github.io/Rajan_Bam_Frontend/`.

A `.nojekyll` file is included so all assets are served as-is.
